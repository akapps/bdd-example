# A BDD use-case using Cucumber

I created this project as a support to a presentation of what BDD is.
It has been built as a step-by-step illustration of how to go BDD using Cucumber.

Following the branch `follow/steps` commit by commit, it is possible to build a (really) simple example
alongside me.
